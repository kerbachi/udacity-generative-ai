    "# Project Instructions\n",
    "To pass this project, your code must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance\n",
    "2. Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the pre-trained model\n",
    "3. Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "This project is fairly open-ended. As long as you follow the prescribed steps, you may choose any appropriate PEFT technique, model, evaluation approach, and fine-tuning dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEFT technique\n",
    "* The PEFT technique covered in this course was LoRA, but new techniques are continuously being developed. See the PEFT README(opens in a new tab) for links to the papers behind each of the supported techniques.\n",
    "* If you are unsure, we recommend using LoRA as your PEFT technique. LoRA is the only PEFT technique that is compatible with all models at this time.\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "* Your choice of model will depend on your choice of PEFT technique.\n",
    "* Unless you plan to use your own hardware/GPU rather than the Udacity Workspace, it's best to choose a smaller model.\n",
    "* The model must be compatible with a sequence classification task.\n",
    "* If you are unsure, we recommend using GPT-2 as your model. This is a relatively small model that is compatible with sequence classification and LoRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "For specific model names in the Hugging Face registry, you can use the widget at the bottom of the PEFT documentation homepage(opens in a new tab) (select \"sequence classification\" from the drop-down).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation approach\n",
    "* The evaluation approach covered in this course was the evaluate method with a Hugging Face Trainer. You may use the same approach, or any other reasonable evaluation approach for a sequence classification task\n",
    "* The key requirement for the evaluation is that you must be able to compare the original foundation model's performance and the fine-tuned model's performance.\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "* Your PEFT process must use a dataset from Hugging Face's datasets library. As with the selection of model, you will need to ensure that the dataset is small enough that it is usable in the Udacity Workspace.\n",
    "* The key requirement for the dataset is that it matches the task. Follow this link to view Hugging Face datasets filtered by the text classification task(opens in a new tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loading and Evaluating a Foundation Model\n",
    "## Loading the model\n",
    "Once you have selected a model, load it in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating the model\n",
    "Perform an initial evaluation of the model on your chosen sequence classification task. This step will require that you also load an appropriate tokenizer and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n",
    "### Creating a PEFT config\n",
    "Create a PEFT config with appropriate hyperparameters for your chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a PEFT model\n",
    "Using the PEFT config and foundation model, create a PEFT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the model\n",
    "Using the PEFT model and dataset, run a training loop with at least one epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving the trained model\n",
    "Depending on your training loop configuration, your PEFT model may have already been saved. If not, use *save_pretrained* to save your progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performing Inference with a PEFT Model\n",
    "### Loading the model\n",
    "Using the appropriate PEFT model class, load your trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the model\n",
    "Repeat the previous evaluation process, this time using the PEFT model. Compare the results to the results from the original foundation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "Projects may be submitted using the Project Workspace or by uploading a zip file or sharing a GitHub repository link on the Project Submission page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission should include the notebook file and saved weights."
